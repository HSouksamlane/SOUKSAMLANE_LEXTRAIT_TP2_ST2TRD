## II. Purpose of the project

The objective of this project is to provide an application capable of encrypting and decrypting your text data.

You have Three Algorithms available :
<ol>
<li>Caesar </li>
<li>Binary</li>
<li>Vigenere</li>
</ol>

Of course, you have the possibility to do the exchange in both directions. Encrypt your data and decrypt it !

## III. How to execute the app

You just have to execute the <b>SOUKSAMLANE_LEXTRAIT_TP2.exe</b> file at the root of the project

## IV. Algorithms Informations 

### 1. Caesar 
Our caesar encryption algorithm is an offset of 2.

---
### 2. Binary
This algorithm encrypts your data in 8-bit binary. In case a non-8-bit number is entered our program will automatically format it into an 8-bit number. In this way the user input remains the same but the program understands your intentions.

Moreover, when decrypting a binary number, if the entered number does not correspond to a visible character of ASCII table, the program will express the error to the user. (I.e. all characters of the ASCII table less than 32 in decimal)

### 3. Vigenere

For Vigenere, we used an encryption using the Vigenere Cypher table to encrypte and decrypt your data. When selecting the Vigenere algorithm, you will notice that a box appears. This is because the encryption is done using a key. 

Also, we have allowed entries that correspond to the entire alphabet from "A" to "Z". Capital letters are treated and do not matter in the key or in the text.

## V. More features

### Gif
We have implemented a gif using a Nugget package named WpfAniatedGif. This integration makes the front end interface dynamic :)

---
### Custom Buttons
You will notice that the button text changes depending on whether we want to encrypt or decrypt our data.
Also, we worked on the design of a button with rounded edges, and a hover that changes color so that the button integrates most closely with our design work
